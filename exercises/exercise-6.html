        <h1>Kalana Amarasekara: About Me</h1>
        <img src="../images/kalana-amarasekara-headshot.jpg" alt="Kalana Amarasekara standing in front of a wall, wearing a checkered shirt with and his glasses.">
        <p>Hello! My name's Kalana Amarasekara, and I'm originally from Sri Lanka. I'm a junior English major and public policy minor taking the PWTC certificate here at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. As with most people, I decided to take the PWTC certificate because it had the best future job prospects, but I have also come to genuinely enjoy taking it.</p> 
        <p>I have learned to create easily accessible digital material that all audiences can use. When I'm not coding or presenting information, I write for the Massachusetts Daily Collegian, where I have served as an Assistant Arts Editor for almost two years (my profile can be found <a href="https://dailycollegian.com/staff_name/kalana-amarasekara/">here</a>), and I am also an intern in the Editorial, Design and Production department of the <a href="https://www.umasspress.com/">University of Massachusetts Press</a>, the University's publishing house.</p>
